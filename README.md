# Leukaemia_Image_Classification

Course Project involving classifying images of cells affected by Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. 
Data consists of microscopic images of immature Leukemia blasts and normal cells. 
Identifying the differences between them is diffcult as they appear almost identical to each other.
The objective is to build an image classification model to distinguish the two and correctly classify the cells affected by Leukemia.

We will first build a basic CNN model as a baseline and then proceed to use a pretrained image model like ResNet, which is expected to perform better in terms of identifying patterns in shapes.
